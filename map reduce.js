 let numbers = [34,89,74,494,303,3,90];
let doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 90);

console.log(doubled);

// map is used for creating new aray thats elemnt which we need as i need this numbers multiply with 90
// than map return me a new array after multiply



let poor = [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]];

let array = poor.flat();

console.log(array);


// flat is used for removing multiple array in a array it will return output in a single 
// array
